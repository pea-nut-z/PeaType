### Context

Under settings you can choose your test time frame and language - by default it is 15 seconds and English. Clicking the "New Quote" button will fetch two random quotes and erase all previous quotes you have done. Clicking the "Redo" button will display previous quotes you have done. This site is tested in Jest with 100% coverage.

### Road blocks

Due to grammar differences in languages, some languages do not have space between words. The spacing plays an important role in my current code, it is an indication to run a function which checks if the input for a word is correct. Therefore, certain selections of language will break the code. This issue will be resolved soon.
