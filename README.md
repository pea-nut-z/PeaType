[Link to site](https://peatype.herokuapp.com/)

### Context

Under settings you can choose your test time frame and language - by default it is 15 seconds and English. Clicking the "New Quote" button will fetch two random quotes and erase all previous quotes you have done. Clicking the "Redo" button will display previous quotes you have done. This site is responsive and tested in Jest with 100% coverage.

The following languages are written from right to left:

- Arabic
- Urdu
- Hebrew

The following languages do not have space between words:

- Chinese
